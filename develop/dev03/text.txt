Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
2 I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
4 Not a yes sir, not a follower
1 Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

1 Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
